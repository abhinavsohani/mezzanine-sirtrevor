eventable
=========

Eventable.js is Backbone.events - ripped straight out of the Backbone source.

Now you can mix Backbone.events into any project without needing to include all of Backbone.

Currently tracking the 1.0.0 version of Backbone - I'll try to keep this updated with the latest from the BB source.

## Bower

I've registered this as a bower package - just include Eventable in your ``bower.json`` file and ``bower install``

## Tests

To run the tests just run ``npm test`` from the console
